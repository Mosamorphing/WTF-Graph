In this lecture, we're going to build up on where we stopped in lesson 02. If you haven't deployed your subgraph in the singraph studio, check the lesson and follow through because in this lecture, we will be publishing our subgraph to the Subgraph Network. 

When you hit the 'publish' button, you see the option to publish to Arbitrum One (recommended) and Arbitrum Sepolia. We will use the testnet (sepolia) to publish and get a feel of publishing subgraphs to decentralized networks before we use the Arbitrum One (mainnet).

# Steps to publish Subgraph to Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet

1. Get Ethereum Sepolia GRT from The Graph Discord

Go to the Discord > roles > choose "T" (Testnet Indexers); this gives you access to the "eth-sepolia-faucet" channel.
In the channel, type "!grt(space)followedByYourWalletAddress" e.g !grt 0x564268FbC519C6bD202C877f6fbc9F2068d3BF53
(add a ss from discord here)

2. Get Ethereum Sepolia Eth from a faucet
3. Get Arbitrum Sepolia Eth from a faucet
4. Bridge Ethereum Seepolia GRT to Arbitrum using Arbitrum Bridge
5. Publish ypur subgraph
